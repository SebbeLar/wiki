==== grep ====

I have aliased grep to Ack which gives me color highlights and line number by default

Basic use for searching a file or files

grep [search phrase] {file(s)}
- grep div index.html
- grep div index.html otherfile.html
- grep div *.html

Basic use for searching recursive thru directories
grep -r [search phrase] directory
- grep -r div .
  * _._ is from directory that we are currently in

Use grep after piping from find
- find . -name "*.html" | xargs grep div

Get Context around the result, gives (N) lines of context After or Before
- grep -A (N) {search phrase}
  * grep -A 2 div
- grep -B (N) {search phrase}
  * grep -B 3 div
- grep -C (N) div {search phrase}
  * grep -C 2 div

Get color highlights for the search phrase (default if using Ack)
- grep --color {search phrase}

Display line number the search phrase match appear on (inc in Ack)
- grep -n {search phrase}

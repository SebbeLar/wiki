== React stuff ==

Did some React stuff and played around with some async calls.
TIL 1: Inside a *fetch* call to an API _this_ is not bound to the class. To get around this use an
arrow function with sets _this_ to the outer scope.

``` Javascript
  fetch('some/api/endpoint')
    .then(function(response) {
        this.setState({
          something: response
         });
    });
```

The above will not work because _this_ is correctly bound. Instead use an arrow function like this.

``` Javascript
  fetch('some/api/endpoint')
    .then((response) => {
        this.setState({
          something: response
         });
    });
 ```

 When we use an arrow function _this_ gets correctly set to the class.

 TIL 2:

 If we need to pass an argument to a function in a *onCLick* attribute then we have to pass that as
 another function.

 ``` Javascript
  onClick={() => this.myFn(argument)}
```

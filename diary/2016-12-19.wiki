== zsh aliases and Git ==

Wrote down a bunch of zsh aliases that i will begin to use in my workflow. Also learned about a few
more Git tricks. When I want to check the diff between my staging area and my last commit, do
`git diff` or use the alias `gd`. When I want to check the diff between my working area and the last
commit do `git diff --cached` or use the alias `gdca`. To display all the changes made to the
commit in the commit message screen do `git commit -v` or use the alias `gc`.

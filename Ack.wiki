== Ack ==

To search type _:Ack [options] {pattern} {(directories)}
It searches recursively in {[directories]} (which defaults to the current directory)

====== Options ======

`-i` Ignores case distinction in pattern
`-v` Inverts the search pattern

====== File extension ======

Instead of specifying a directory you can specify a file extension instead.
Just add `--` followed by the extension. `--js`, `--css`.
Warning .jsx and .elm are not supported.

==== Key bindings ====

`O` Opens the file and closes the quicklist window
`go` Open a preview of the file but maintains focus on the quicklist window
`h` Opens a horizontal split
`v` Opens a vertical split
`q` closes the quicklist window
